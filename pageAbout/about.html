            <p class="lead">Natural Wonders Childcare Center is located near downtown Howard City, approximately 2 miles off of 131 highway.  Natural Wonders has 1 classroom that is licensed for 8 infants & toddlers and 1 classroom that is licensed for 20 preschool/school-agers.</p>
            <p>Natural Wonders Childcare Center is the area's leading childcare facility, focusing on partnering with families to develop an in-depth and rewarding early educational experience for each child that is guaranteed to stay with them for a life time!    </p>
            <p>Natural Wonders Childcare Center utilizes their creative and educated staff members to implement engaging daily lesson plans and activities while following developmentally appropriate practices.  Natural Wonders Childcare Center stresses PROCESS over PRODUCT with projects which let each child discover their own self-esteem and creativity while exploring project elements uniquely versus displaying projects that fundamentally all look the same with a common outcome.  </p>
            <p>Natural Wonders Childcare Center's lead teaching staff also conduct the Ages & Stages Questinaires (ASQ) Screening once per year as well as the Creative Curriculum Developmental Continuum Assessment in order to see each child's unique developmental scale and use the results to pin-point which areas are needed for extra practice through fun lesson plans and activities. </p>
            <p>Parent Communication is very important here at Natural Wonders Childcare Center!  In our Infant & Toddler and Preschool Programs, an app is used to update parents on feeding details, diapering/toileting details, pictures and any other communication needed of each child's day and in real-time!  Our families LOVE the convenience of seeing the details of their child's day at the push of a button and being able to communicate directly with their child's teacher just as quickly.  Natural Wonders also sends out a monthly center-wide newsletters which inform parents of any special dates that month, parent reminders, parent discussions, and so much more!  </p>
            <p>Natural Wonders Childcare Center staff also prides themselves on creating a warm, trusting relationship with parents!  Parents feel comfortable asking any questions or voicing any concerns that they may have with staff members, as well as the center director!</p>
            <p><strong>Natural Wonders Childcare Center, Where learning comes naturally!</strong></p>
